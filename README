# WallChanger
Changes your wallpapers based on time of day.

# Features
- Wallpaper change timings are based on time of day, not a delay from the last set like in Windows.
- Random order mode.
- Switch between multiple saved configurations.
- Wallpaper library
  - Add tags, categories and other information to images.
  - Easily add images from library to active config.
  - Duplicate image scanning.
  - Caches image sizes.
- Supports all Windows wallpaper set options including Span on Windows 8+.
- Can toggle using Active Desktop to fade wallpaper changes.
- Interface fully localisable. Currently only available in English and minor sections in Japanese.

**NOTE: on Windows 7, using fade will cause Windows to convert the image to a jpeg before setting it. On Windows 10 (and probably 8 & 8.1) Windows will convert the wallpaper to a jpeg unless you use fading.**
